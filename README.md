## Typescript Boilerplate

It's really nothing special. I just don't want to have to do this every time.
The boilerplate allows you to try things from react-typescript or just vanilla typescript.

Check the `target/index.html` to see your code run.

## Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aburd/typescript-boilerplate.git
$ cd typescript-boilerplate
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

### React (TSX)

- Support for typescript (see src/components/App.tsx)
- Support for SCSS (see src/styles.scss)

### Other

- If you just want to test out something in typescript, checkout src/other.ts
